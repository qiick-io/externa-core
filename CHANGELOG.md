The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Docker deploy DX: GHCR multi-arch publish on `v*` tags, `compose.quick.yaml` pull path, gated `RUN_SEED` first-boot, healthchecks on quick Compose (#56)

### Security

- Outbound webhooks refuse delivery when the signing secret is empty (no empty-key HMAC) (#88)

## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2026-09-17

### Changed

- create-project Composer post-scripts stay minimal (handoff to `externa:install`; no auto-migrate/SQLite assumption) (#93)
- npm `prepare` no-ops Lefthook without `.git` (Docker `image-build` green) (#94)
- Dependency refresh within constraints; skipped reckless majors documented in #95

### Fixed

- Docker `php-base`: pin phpredis `6.3.0` from GitHub tarball (bypass flaky `pecl install redis` / `No releases available for package "pecl.php.net/redis"` on multiarch-bake)

### Security

- Private effective files use non-public `private_assets` disk; block SVG/HTML/HTM uploads (#84, #85)
- AI collection-import webhook requires HMAC over body + `collection_id` (#86)

### Added

- Larastan/PHPStan level 5 + baseline in CI lint gate (#87)

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Docker Compose local + production-oriented stacks (`compose.yaml`, `compose.prod.yaml`, multi-stage `Dockerfile`)

- `FILES_DISK` + Flysystem S3 adapter for MinIO / multi-instance uploads
- MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL Pest jobs in CI
- Duplicate action for non-system roles
- Transactional email branding from Appearance / Project settings

### Changed

### Upgrade notes

- Prefer S3/MinIO via `FILES_DISK` for multi-container file storage
- Wire LB/Compose checks to `/health/live` and `/health/ready`
- Compose app port defaults to `:8000` — set `COMPOSE_APP_URL` accordingly
- Laravel Herd local workflow unchanged
